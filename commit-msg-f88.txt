Session: Feature #88 - Code complete, blocked by database migration

Feature #88: Abandon Decision with Reason and Note

Status:
- Code: 100% COMPLETE ✅
- Database: BLOCKED ❌ (columns do not exist)
- Testing: BLOCKED (cannot test without DB migration)

What Was Done:
- Verified all backend code is implemented (DecisionService.abandonDecision)
- Verified all frontend code is implemented (abandon modal, UI, displays)
- Verified migration file exists (migration-add-abandonment-columns.sql)
- Confirmed database columns do NOT exist via API testing
- Attempted multiple migration approaches (all blocked by lack of DB access)

Blocker:
- abandon_reason and abandon_note columns missing from decisions table
- Cannot apply ALTER TABLE via Supabase REST API
- No direct database credentials available
- Requires manual SQL execution in Supabase Dashboard

Code Implemented:
- Backend: POST /decisions/:id/abandon endpoint in server.ts
- Backend: DecisionService.abandonDecision() in decisionServiceNew.ts
- Frontend: Abandon button, modal, form in DecisionDetailPage.tsx
- Migration: migration-add-abandonment-columns.sql ready to run

Required Action:
Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/doqojfsldvajmlscpwhu/sql

ALTER TABLE decisions
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS abandon_reason VARCHAR(50);

ALTER TABLE decisions
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS abandon_note TEXT;
