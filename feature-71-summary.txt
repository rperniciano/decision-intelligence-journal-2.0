# Feature #71: Pending reviews reflect actual due decisions - PASSING ✅

**Date**: January 20, 2026
**Feature**: #71 - Pending reviews reflect actual due decisions
**Category**: Real Data Verification
**Status**: ✅ PASSING

## Feature Requirements

Verify pending reviews are real:
1. Create and complete a decision with reminder
2. Set reminder to past date (or use test)
3. Navigate to dashboard
4. Verify decision appears in Pending Reviews
5. Complete the review
6. Verify removed from Pending Reviews

## Implementation Summary

### Bug Fix: API Endpoint Not Filtering by Outcome

The `/api/v1/pending-reviews` endpoint was NOT filtering decisions where an outcome had already been recorded. This meant decisions would remain in Pending Reviews even after the user completed the review.

**Fix Applied:**
Added `.is('outcome', null)` filter to the query in `apps/api/src/server.ts` (line 1911).

## Testing Results

### ✅ Test 1: Decision with Past Due Date Appears in Pending Reviews
- Created test decision: "TEST F71 - Should I buy a new laptop"
- Set follow_up_date to current time
- Decision appeared in Pending Reviews section ✅

### ✅ Test 2: Recording Outcome Removes Decision from Pending Reviews
- Recorded outcome: "Better"
- Returned to dashboard
- Pending Reviews section now empty ✅

### ✅ Test 3: Database Verification - Real Data (No Mock)
- Decision exists in real Supabase database
- Outcome: "better" recorded at 2026-01-20T11:42:04.332+00:00
- No mock data detected

### ✅ Test 4: API Endpoint Correctly Filters
- Added .is('outcome', null) filter
- Only decisions without outcomes appear in Pending Reviews
