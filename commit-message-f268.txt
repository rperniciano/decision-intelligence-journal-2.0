feat(concurrency): implement AbortController for race condition prevention - Feature #268

Add AbortController pattern to all useEffect hooks with fetch operations to prevent
race conditions during rapid navigation. This ensures users always see correct data
for the current page, not stale data from previous pages.

## Problem
When users navigate rapidly between pages, multiple fetch requests can be in flight.
Without cleanup, all responses update state, causing the last response to win
regardless of navigation order. This results in stale data display.

## Solution
Implemented AbortController pattern in 5 files (8 useEffect hooks total):

### Files Modified:
1. HistoryPage.tsx - Categories fetch, Decisions fetch (with cursor pagination)
2. DashboardPage.tsx - Statistics fetch, Pending reviews fetch
3. DecisionDetailPage.tsx - Decision data fetch, Reminders fetch
4. CategoriesPage.tsx - Categories fetch on mount
5. InsightsPage.tsx - Insights data fetch

## Verification
✅ Browser automation test completed
✅ Rapid navigation between pages works correctly
✅ Each page shows only its own data (no stale data)
✅ AbortErrors properly silenced (not shown to users)
✅ Tested on History page (3 pages with pagination)
✅ No console errors or UI flickering

- Feature #268 verified and marked as PASSING ✅
