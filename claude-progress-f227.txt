[Testing] Feature #227 Regression Test - 2026-01-20
Status: REGRESSION DETECTED - Fix attempted but unsuccessful

Issue: Toast notifications replace each other instead of stacking
Fix Attempted:
- Added flex container with flex-col and gap-4 for vertical stacking
- Removed fixed positioning from individual Toast components
- Added index prop to Toast components

Result: Despite correct implementation, toasts still don't stack
Only one toast visible at any given time during testing

Technical Details:
- Container with correct classes is present in DOM
- No TypeScript compilation errors
- No JavaScript runtime errors
- Toast state management appears to be the root cause

Files Modified:
- apps/web/src/contexts/ToastContext.tsx
- apps/web/src/components/Toast.tsx

Recommendation: Further debugging needed with React DevTools to inspect
toast state array and AnimatePresence behavior

Feature #227 Status: FAILING
