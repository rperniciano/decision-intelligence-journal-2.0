Feature #269: API response after navigation no crash - Manual Test Plan
===========================================================================

Test Objective:
Verify that late API responses (after navigation) don't cause crashes and don't affect the new page.

Preconditions:
- Servers running (API on port 3001, Web on port 5173)
- Test user exists: test_f269@example.com / testpass123

Test Steps:

1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/login
2. Login as test_f269@example.com
3. Click on "History" link
4. IMMEDIATELY (within 200ms) click on "Dashboard" link
   - This aborts the History page request
5. Wait 2 seconds for the late response to potentially arrive
6. Check for:
   - Any console errors (F12 -> Console)
   - Any visible crashes or white screens
   - Dashboard functionality (can you click things?)
7. Navigate to History again and let it load fully
8. Verify History page works correctly
9. Repeat steps 3-8 five times rapidly

Expected Results:
✓ No console errors
✓ No crashes or white screens
✓ Dashboard remains functional after rapid navigation
✓ History page loads correctly on subsequent tries
✓ No memory leaks (browser doesn't slow down after multiple rapid navigations)

Actual Results:
[To be filled during testing]

Browser Automation Test:
Using Playwright MCP tool for automated verification.
