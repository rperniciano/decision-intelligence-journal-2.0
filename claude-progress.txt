## Blockers & Skipped Features
The following features were skipped because they require Supabase to be configured with valid credentials:
- #9: Session token expiration
- #10: Logout clears session data
- #12: Expired auth token rejected
- #13-15: Cross-user data isolation tests
- #16-25: Various auth-dependent security features
- #26+: Navigation features (require login)

## Next Steps for Future Agents
1. **CRITICAL: Configure Supabase**
   - Create a Supabase project
   - Add VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY to .env
   - Add SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
   - Run database migrations to create tables

2. **Database Setup**
   - Create profiles, decisions, options, pros_cons tables
   - Set up Row Level Security policies
   - Create indexes for performance

3. **Continue Feature Implementation**
   - Once Supabase is configured, run skipped auth features
   - Implement decision CRUD functionality
   - Build out the recording and voice pipeline

## Notes
- Frontend runs on http://localhost:5173 (or 5174 if 5173 is busy)
- API runs on http://localhost:3001
- Both servers auto-reload on file changes
- The app gracefully handles missing Supabase config (shows "not configured" errors)

---
Session 2 complete. Authentication foundation in place. Supabase configuration needed to continue.
