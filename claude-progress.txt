FEATURE #100 AND #101 SESSION - 2026-01-20 (CONTINUED)
================================================================================

Feature #100: Complete onboarding flow end-to-end
Status: SKIPPED (Implementation Required)
Original Priority: 319
New Priority: 352

Reason: Onboarding flow exists but is not integrated with the actual voice
recording and AI extraction flow. The OnboardingPage.tsx is a simple
tutorial carousel that doesn't:
- Capture name via conversational UI
- Guide users through first voice recording
- Show AI extraction "magic moment" reveal
- Provide inline editing tutorial

This requires significant new implementation per app spec.

Feature #101: Set and manage reminder
Status: SKIPPED (Database Schema Mismatch)
Original Priority: 320
New Priority: 353

Blocker: Database schema mismatch
Error: "Could not find the 'remind_at' column of 'DecisionsFollowUpReminders'"

Code expects:
- Table: DecisionsFollowUpReminders
- Columns: remind_at, status, decision_id, user_id

Database likely has:
- Different column names (migration not executed or has wrong schema)

✅ UI Component Exists:
   - Set Reminder button on DecisionDetailPage
   - Reminder modal with Date/Time inputs
   - Timezone display
   - Cancel/Set Reminder buttons

✅ API Endpoint Exists:
   - POST /api/v1/decisions/:id/reminders (create)
   - GET /api/v1/decisions/:id/reminders (list)
   - PATCH /api/v1/decisions/:id/reminders/:id (update)
   - DELETE /api/v1/decisions/:id/reminders/:id (delete)

❌ Database Schema Mismatch:
   - Column name doesn't match what code expects
   - Migration needs to be corrected and executed

================================================================================
PATTERN: MULTIPLE FEATURES BLOCKED BY DATABASE MIGRATIONS
================================================================================

The following features are code-complete but blocked by database migrations:
- Feature #77: Multiple check-ins tracking (outcomes table)
- Feature #88: Transition to Abandoned status (abandon_reason, abandon_note)
- Feature #91: Record detailed outcome with rating (needs outcomes table)
- Feature #101: Set and manage reminder (reminders table schema)

Root Cause: Database migrations were created but not executed in Supabase.

Solution Required:
1. Execute all pending migrations in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Verify table schemas match what code expects
3. Test features end-to-end
