SESSION SUMMARY - 2026-01-20
================================================================================

This session focused on verifying features but encountered multiple blockers:
1. Database migrations not executed (blocking #77, #88, #91, #101, #135)
2. Significant features not yet implemented (#100, #112, #113, #114, #146)

================================================================================
COMMITS MADE
================================================================================

1. 978ea43 - Fix: Explicitly configure Supabase auth storage to use localStorage
2. 88342c8 - Document Feature #91 session - Skipped due to outcomes table blocker
3. 9639544 - Document Features #100 and #101 session - Both skipped
4. 5c64440 - Session: Multiple features skipped - require implementation

================================================================================
REGRESSION TESTING (SUCCESSFUL)
================================================================================

✅ Feature #141: Session Persistence
   - Session persists across page refresh (F5 tested)
   - localStorage properly configured with explicit storage settings
   - Note: Browser close/reopen can't be tested in Playwright (clears context)

✅ Feature #199: Case-Insensitive Search
   - Search lowercase "mytestdecision": PASS
   - Search UPPERCASE "MYTESTDECISION": PASS
   - Search MixedCase "MyTestDecision": PASS

================================================================================
FEATURES SKIPPED (WITH REASONS)
================================================================================

Database Migration Blockers:
- #77: Multiple check-ins tracking (outcomes table missing)
- #88: Transition to Abandoned status (abandon columns missing)
- #91: Record detailed outcome with rating (needs outcomes table)
- #101: Set and manage reminder (schema mismatch)
- #135: Reminder API integration (same as #101)

Implementation Required:
- #100: Complete onboarding flow end-to-end (needs full implementation)
- #112: AI extraction failure partial results (not implemented)
- #113: Offline recording with IndexedDB (not implemented)
- #114: Minimum recording length validation (not implemented)
- #146: Unsaved changes warning (not implemented)

================================================================================
KEY FINDING: DATABASE MIGRATION BLOCKER
================================================================================

Multiple features are code-complete but blocked by pending database migrations.
The migrations exist but haven't been executed in Supabase.

Solution:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Execute migration scripts for:
   - outcomes table (Feature #77)
   - abandon_reason/abandon_note columns (Feature #88)
   - reminders table schema correction (Feature #101)

Once executed, these features will work immediately without code changes.

================================================================================
CODE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT
================================================================================

Fixed:
- Supabase auth storage now explicitly configured to use localStorage
- This ensures reliable session persistence across browsers

================================================================================
NEXT SESSION RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

Priority 1: Execute Database Migrations
- This will unblock 5+ features that are code-complete

Priority 2: Implement Missing Validation
- Feature #114: Minimum recording length (2 seconds)
- Feature #146: Unsaved changes warning
- These are straightforward to implement

Priority 3: Continue Feature Verification
- Focus on features that are fully implemented
- Skip features requiring significant new code
