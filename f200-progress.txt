[FEATURE #200] Filter by date range works
Date: 2026-01-20
Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED AND VERIFIED PASSING

Implementation:
---------------
Backend (apps/api/src/services/decisionServiceNew.ts):
- Added fromDate and toDate parameters to getDecisions() filter interface
- Applied date range filtering to both count query and main query
- Converts date-only strings (YYYY-MM-DD) to proper ISO timestamps
- Uses Supabase's gte/lte operators for created_at column

Frontend (apps/web/src/pages/HistoryPage.tsx):
- Added 'Custom Range' option to timeFilterOptions
- Added customFromDate and customToDate state variables
- Added date input fields that appear when timeFilter === 'custom_range'
- Date inputs update URL parameters (fromDate, toDate)
- URL persistence: Filter state preserved across page refreshes
- 'Remove time filter' button clears custom range
- API query includes fromDate/toDate when custom_range is active

Testing Results:
----------------
✅ Created 4 test decisions with different dates
✅ Test 1: Date range Jan 14 - Jan 20 - Correctly showed 2 decisions
✅ Test 2: Single day filter (Jan 20) - Correctly showed 1 decision
✅ Test 3: Remove filter - Correctly showed all 4 decisions
✅ Test 4: URL persistence - Date range preserved in URL and inputs
