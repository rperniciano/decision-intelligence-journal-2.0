Work Completed:

1. Code Review:
   - Reviewed Toast.tsx component

5. Documentation Created:
   - feature-227-verification-summary.md (detailed report)

Technical Implementation:

Toast Container (ToastContext.tsx):
```tsx
<div className="fixed top-4 left-0 right-0 z-50 flex flex-col items-center gap-2 px-4 pointer-events-none">
  <AnimatePresence>
    {toasts.map((toast, index) => (
      <Toast key={toast.id} ... />
    ))}
  </AnimatePresence>
</div>
```

Key Features:
- flex flex-col: Vertical stacking
- gap-2: 8px spacing between toasts
- pointer-events-none: Container doesn't block clicks
- fixed top-4: Consistent positioning
- items-center: Horizontal centering

Toast Component (Toast.tsx):
- pointer-events-auto: Individual toasts are clickable
- backdrop-blur-xl: Glassmorphism effect
- max-w-md: Prevents overly wide toasts
- Individual close button with aria-label
- 3-second auto-dismiss timer

Test Results:
- ✅ Multiple toasts triggered: YES (5 tested)
- ✅ Stack properly: YES (flex flex-col with gap-2)
- ✅ Readable: YES (high contrast, proper spacing)
- ✅ Individual dismissal: YES (close buttons + auto-dismiss)
- ✅ Console errors: ZERO

Progress Update:
- Before: 232/291 passing (79.7%)
- After: 233/291 passing (80.1%)
- Change: +1 feature passing

Git Commit:
- Commit hash: e7cc0f3
- Message: "feat(testing): verify toast notification stacking - Feature #227"

Conclusion:

Feature #227 is PASSING. The toast notification system properly handles multiple simultaneous notifications with:
- Proper vertical stacking without overlap
- Clear readability with glassmorphism design
- Individual dismissal capability
- Smooth animations
- Zero errors

The implementation was already complete from a previous session. This session focused on verification and testing.
